They define themselves as a band and a social movement. They started playing in the streets of their native town and after their first tour and subsequent time in London 'Onwards' their debut album that was released in 2011 was born. It marked the path of their very intense and emotional folk that was open to influences. In 2014, after 3 years discovering what they wanted to be as a band, they released their second album 'Pangea' that was recorded in a former shoe factory and that sounds more complete and ambitious than what you would expect from such a young band. They have supported José González and Okkervil River and have played festivals such as Glastonbury, The Great Escape and United Islands. Check them out!(text from www.primaverasound.com)"},

Albert Hammond junior’s biography speaks of a family pedigree (his father is the famous British composer Albert Hammond) and of a band, The Strokes, with which he shook up rock at the end of the last century, and about a solo career in which the guitarist explores pop from a more domestic and light-hearted perspective. 'Your’s To Keep', his 2006 debut, was a pleasant surprise and the perfect compliment for the New York band’s discography; a record that exuded pop and classical rock that he followed up with 'Cómo Te Llama?' and with the EP 'AHJ', on which the effervescent electricity makes one think of Guided By Voices doing cover versions of the Beach Boys.(text from www.primaverasound.com)"},

The fact that they won the Mercury Prize in 2012 for their bizarre debut, 'An Awesome Wave', was a complete surprise, but seeing their second album, 'This Is All Yours', being received as a phenomenon of the year defeats all logic. This trio from Leeds, rara avis of British pop, has managed to embrace commercial and creative success with their complex and twisted mixture of hip hop, folk, dubstep, rock and songs that aspire to be works of art. With Joe Newman’s voice as an exotic lure and a second album that has shot to the top of British charts, Alt-J has not only got onto the podium but as done it waving the banner of the most addictive heterodoxy.(text from www.primaverasound.com)"},

They only released one album and an EP, but it was enough for American Football to make a name for themselves in the history of indie as the connection between post-rock and emocore. Capturing the anguish of the moment and bringing indie closer to a virtuosity bursting with subtlety, nuances, confessions and connections with math-rock and inflamed slowcore, the Illinois band debuted in 1998 with the EP 'American Football', they gave it all on a debut that was also self-titled and, only one year later were no more. Now, fourteen years after their split, the trio formed by Mike Kinsella, Steve Lamos and Steve Holmes are back with a luxury re release of their debut and a tour to vindicate the mark they made on the music scene.(text from www.primaverasound.com)"},

Without giving up that crazy extravagance and charm that he flaunted on 'The Doldrums', his debut on Paw Tracks, Animal Collective’s label, Ariel Pink continues to grow as the neurotic author and composer of an unpredictable stream of psychedelic pop, AOR, warped folk, soul and homemade electronic music. Freed from his band moniker Haunted Grafitti with which he recorded half a dozen albums, this Los Angeles artist gives free rein to his iconoclastic spirit on 'Pom Pom', the first album that he releases solo under his name. It is a dazzling album overflowing with enthusiasm and pop energy that at times has hints of Frank Zappa and at others dark sounds of the eighties or crystalline melodies of the seventies.(text from www.primaverasound.com)"},

Four decades after Arthur Russell created 'Instrumentals' a musical odyssey in 150 movements composed so that it could be performed either by a sextet or by an orchestra, Peter Gordon composer and former collaborator of Russell’s, is bring it back to stage one of the important projects of the American musician and composer who died in 1992. A necessary homage to a capital figure who, as well as sharing aesthetic inclinations with Philip Glass and Steve Reich, was able to go further alternating minimalism with dance music and rock with neoclassical music. In the last few years artists such as Robyn, Hot Chip, José González, Scissor Sisters and Ólöf Arnalds, among others, have vindicated the master from the past of avant-garde.(text from www.primaverasound.com)"}}
